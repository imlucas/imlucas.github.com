# Standalone Executables Part 2: Python

python: [esky][esky]
- [saltstack][saltstack] uses this for their agent

- I wrote a POC using esky to replace our complicated as hell chef deployment w a python exe that just ran a bash script :p
- same major pains Akira/Ger were describing
- bc of your work on evergreen for compass we can sign the exes as well!
