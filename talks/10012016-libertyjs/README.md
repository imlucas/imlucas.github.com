## CFP

**Using electron to bring web apps to the desktop at MongoDB**

When I first started building the official UI for MongoDB, it was a web app
built on node.js. After a few months of alpha testing, it still felt like it was
missing something.  On a hunch, I started experimenting with electron from
GitHub's Atom Editor team.  Electron allows for building desktop applications
using JS, HTML and CSS. Within a week of experimenting, I found what had been
missing from the web app experience. This has opened a whole new world of
creative possibilities for me personally and I'd love to share my experiences.

I hope to answer a few questions in telling this story:
-  What is electron and how does it work?
-  What are the advantages of delivering desktop apps for JS developers?
-  Why are desktop apps good business?

The UI for MongoDB (which I'll avoid talking about directly as much as possible) is now called [Compass][compass]. I'm [@imlucas on GitHub][@imlucas]. My desk is in NYC, but most of the time I'm working from home in the Fairmount neighborhood of Philadelphia.
