What are the three things the audience is going to learn from your story? *
Your answer

What is the problem you’re trying to solve *
People love solving problems. Your presentation is the exploration and resolution of a technical problem, focused around MongoDB. Several questions need to be answered: What is the problem? Why should we care about the problem you are investigating? What should the audience expect to learn from your story or examination of this problem? Write out these questions below:
Your answer

Introduce yourself *
Let the audience get to know something about you. Offering a brief description of your professional background helps the audience understand your unique perspective. What is your experience with the topic? In what situations have you encountered this problem or issue before?
Your answer

How did you solve the problem *
Here you are not describing the results of the problem you solved, but how you solved it. The pitfalls you encountered and the strategies you used to fix the problem are the most compelling content you can share with the audience at MongoDB World. Write out three of these “pitfalls”, “strategies” or “lessons” that showcase how you thought through the problem. Then indicate what the audience will learn from each of these.
Your answer

Describe the solution (This will be the largest part of your talk) *
Finally, you get to showcase the final results of your investigation. This is a way to bring together all you learned throughout your application development and let the audience see how you arrived at your solution. This section should occupy the largest portion of your presentation. Write down what your final product is, and why it works. Please reference applicable metrics that showcase the improvements the solution had on your product. Feel free to reference items from the previous section (e.g. we knew to use X as a shard key because we ran into these problems during our development.) It’s good to repeat things in presentations as it allows you to emphasize key points.
Your answer

Thinking to the future *
How has what you learned during this time impacted what you plan to do tomorrow? Have you adopted new methodologies that increase your application development time? How will it impact the audience? How can they take your lessons and bring it to the workplace? Identify each of these in the space below.
Your answer
