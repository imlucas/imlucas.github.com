| Part of the Series:
| JavaScript You Should Know About
| — Changes Since Douglas Crockford Got Upset And Wrote A Book About It 6 Years Ago
```

## Abstract

Let’s talk about some simple things that will make you think differently about your javascript, existing or future:

- A brief introduction to the [node package manager](http://npmjs.org) and why it’s a terrible name
- Introduce you to [browserify](http://browserify.org) and sane dependency management in the browser
- Publish a module to npm and use it in chrome, nodejs and [mongo](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/master/src/mongo/scripting/engine_v8.cpp#L563)

## About

[lucas](https://github.com/imlucas) is working on a new project for MongoDB
called mongoscope, a UI to explore and administer deployments big and small.
He has spent far too much time over the past 10 years making things in java,
python, javascript, the C's, and even a web server for actionscript 3.
