A Writings Repo
===============

A crucial factor of design and programming is actually being able to express
yourself and your ideas.  Writing about your code or designs makes you process
your work on a different level and leads to new personal discoveries in process
and optimization.  At ex.fm, we've been trying to work writing into our
regular workflow to get better.  We're heads down all week shipping, but on
Friday's we focus on improving our skills by doing a lot of writing and talking
about what we've been doing.

We have a writings Github repository that anyone can drop anything in at anytime.
Using a repo makes it extremely simple to track changes, get feedback in commit
comments and take edits as pull requests.  We use Google Docs a lot, but for this
process Github is hands down better.  As developers, we get to use our normal
toolchain (Sublime Text, GitX, etc) and workflow (commit, push, pull request).

It also brings the added benefit as an easy introduction to git for non-developers.
Our ideal is everyone in the company can share code and contribute to ex.fm
directly.  The writings repo provides an easy entrypoint for getting into this
flow.

This is still a very new piece of our process, so we'll see how it goes. So far,
so good.
